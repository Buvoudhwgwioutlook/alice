locks have been used to fasten doors against thieves since earliest times
the old testament contains several references to locks and the first archaeological evidence of locks are about 4000 years old
these are egyptian locks depicted in the pyramids
these earliest locks were of a type known as pin tumbler and they are actually not very different from common door locks in use today
the egyptian lock consisted of a heavy wooden housing mounted to the door
a wooden bolt passed through the lock and was held in place by iron pins which dropped into slots and held it firm
the key was a straight piece of wood with pegs projecting up from its end
when the key was inserted and pushed upwards the pegs on the key lifted the pins in the lock and the bolt was freedthe greeks developed a simple door lock by about 700 bc
this used a latchstring to pull a bolt through brackets in the door
by pulling the string the homeowner could lock the door from the outside
then the string was stuffed back through the keyhole
the key itself was a sickleshaped piece of metal from two to three feet long
the key could be fitted into the hole in the lock to pull back the bolt from the outside
the major drawback to this lock was that anyone with a curved stick or their own key could open it
and the large metal key was cumbersome
many entities such as universities and large corporate headquarters that use large numbers of locks are converting to electronic passkey systems
these use a magnetic swipe card to open a door
the cards can have a bar code on them and computers can be used to store information on who goes in through each door raising privacy issues for some concerned people
other hightech locks open with voice activation or palm or fingerprint recognition
such locks offer relatively high security but are generally too expensive and elaborate for the ordinary citizen's home
however the trend towards these kinds of electronic and computercontrolled locks is growing in the late 1990s and they will undoubtedly be more prevalent in the future
